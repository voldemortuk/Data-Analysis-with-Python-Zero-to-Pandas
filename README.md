# Data Analysis with Python: Zero to Pandas
This repository documents my work done during the [Data Analysis with Python: Zero to Pandas](https://jovian.ai/learn/data-analysis-with-python-zero-to-pandas) based on Pytorch and offered from Jovian.ml, the lessons were streamed on the Freecodecamp youtube channel, [my Jovian profile](https://jovian.ai/utkarsh02dec) contains all the notebooks written during the course.

### The course was composed of six lessons and 4 projects

## Lesson 1 - Introduction to Programming with Python
    Course overview & curriculum walkthrough
    First steps with Python and Jupyter notebooks
    A quick tour of variables and data types
    Branching with conditional statements and loops

## Lesson 2 - Next Steps with Python
    Branching with conditional statements and loops
    Write reusable code with Functions
    Working with the OS & Filesystem
    Assignment and course forum walkthrough
    
## Assignment 1 - Python Basics Practice
    Solve word problems using variables & arithmetic operations
    Manipulate data types using methods & operators
